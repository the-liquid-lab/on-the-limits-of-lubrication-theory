citet:Cortelezzi1981 propose a derivation of the equations governing the
initial value problem for a disturbed layer of viscous fluid,
considering both the effects of gravity and surface tension. We here
propose to revisit this paper by proposing an alternative derivation
based on the ideas of citet:Prosperetti1976. More specifically we split
the dynamical variables into a potential and a viscous contribution. We
restrict the analysis to a 2D setting, and note that all the obtained
results can be directly transposed to 3D, see citet:Cortelezzi1981.

Vorticity production
====================

The vorticity is directed along **e**<sub>*y*</sub>:

Introducing the viscous shear stress $\\tau\_{xz} = \\mu \\left(
\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} \\right)$
we can express the vorticity in terms of viscous shear stress:
$$
\\omega\_y = \\frac{\\tau\_{xz}}{\\mu} - 2 \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}
$$
At the free surface, the tangential shear stress vanishes so
$\\omega\_y = - 2 \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}$ there.
